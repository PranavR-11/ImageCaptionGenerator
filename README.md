# ImageCaptionGenerator
Image Captioning is the process of giving an image an appropriate caption. People communicate through language, whether written or spoken. They often use this language to describe the visual world around them. 
This model consists of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) as well as Long Short Term Memory(LSTM). The CNN is used for feature extraction from image and LSTM is used for sentence generation.
The dataset we have used in this model is the flickr8k dataset.
